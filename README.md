I've chosen projects that are ones I'd really like to explore for my final project, even though I don't know too much about how their generation works - hopefully I can learn enough to explore something like this for the final!

#Project 1: Meandering River, Google

Final Visual:
A sequence of abstract artwork - constantly moving pieces

Project Description: 
Using machine learning to study the satellite images of how rivers change position overtime and generating abstract artwork from it.

Needed resources:
Satellite images, dates of them being taken, color palettes 

Simulation:
A combination of different algorithms simulating the behavior of the changing rivers based on the pictures taken
Development of new visual shaders that would represent erosion, change of vegetation, etc
