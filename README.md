I've chosen projects that are ones I'd really like to explore for my final project, even though I don't know too much about how their generation works - hopefully I can learn enough to explore something like this for the final!

Project 1: Meandering River, Google

Final Visual:
A sequence of abstract artwork - constantly moving pieces

Project Description: 
Using machine learning to study the satellite images of how rivers change position overtime and generating abstract artwork from it.

Needed resources:
Satellite images, dates of them being taken, color palettes 

Simulation:
A combination of different algorithms simulating the behavior of the changing rivers based on the pictures taken
Development of new visual shaders that would represent erosion, change of vegetation, etc

Project 2: A Neural Network That Sees Nothing But Art

Final Visual:
Side-by-side comparisons of before and after webcam footage of mundane objects being turned into artwork.

Project Description:
The algorithm draws from tens of thousands of images scraped from the Google Arts Project, an extensive collection of super high resolution images of notable artworks. It tries to match up whatever sees on the webcam to a pre-trained list of objects in the paintings and combines the visuals of one and the other.

Needed resources:
High quality images of artwork, music, webcam footage
